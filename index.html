        <h1><p><b>HELLO WANDERER!</b></p></h1>
        <h2>Come on! Let's all gather around</h2>
        <div class="campfire-image"></div>
        <p><b>ALRIGHT!</b> Great timing too, I was getting ready to give a brief summary of myself and you've stumble upon my page.</p>
        <p>Why don't you stay around and come get to know me a little bit better, who knows maybe we can be friends.</p>
        <p>Well just your average young adult here, seeking new ways to better myself, both mentally and physically. Learning is a part of the process and don't we all have some stories about that. There's no worries there. Just grab a sit and let's just talk and get to know one another? What do you say?</p>
        <p>My goal right now is to be able to pursue my career goals. Mainly continuing on my bachelor degree on Emerging Media Game design or maybe decide on Physical Computation.</p>

        <h1><b>Career Plan</b></h1>
        <p>Being indecisive after finsihing up high school really took a toll on me. What I want to do was so vague. Younger me had no clue that I would still be indecisive with what I want to do.</p>
        <p>I plan on following my career path, which is Emerging Media because I enjoy simply it. This year I was able to put it to a test and was the result satisfying and of course I did not succeed at first but, after constantly attempting the more sense it became for me.</p>
        <p>However though, I'm still sure if my younger self, he would see how I'm still indecisive. I'm stuck between <b>Game Design and Physical Computation</b>. </p>
        <p>Both these career provide so much information to learn and to intake but, just doing what you love is how I want to spend my time. Having working in retail for such a long time really just makes me feel unhappy honestly. Always wanting to be in the <b>Game Design</b> and <b>Physical Computation</b> field I finally decided that I should return back to school.</p>
        <p>I believe maybe the reason why I can't decide is because I want to pursue both career path.</p>
        <h5>Here's my latest work</h5>
        <div class="circle-image"></div>
        <p>Here is just one of the many work that I've been working on this semester.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="info" id="Third">
        <h1><b>Education</b></h1>
        <p>Currently enroll <b>New York City College of Technology</b> also know as City Tech</p>
        <p>This would actually be my second semester attending. I first graduated from <b>Borough of Manhattan Community College</b> where I struggled through a lot to get to where I am now.</p>
        <p>Since I only attended one semester I only seen the main building. I was excited returning back but, because of COVID classes became virtual classes.</p>
        <p>Grateful I am to be returning to attend classes and all but, I feel it's not the the same college experience you get when you're on campus. Being able to communicate in person and not through you computer. </p>
        <p>My career plan is to further my pursue my passion in Emerging Media field. Conflicted between working on <b>Game Design and Physical Computation</b> are both my main interest in what I do. Struggling on deciding which one is very problematic but, I'm still learning both while I finally decide. Who knows, I might decide on both. </p>
