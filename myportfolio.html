      <h1><b>So about myself...</b></h1>
      <p>Well hello there! I'm so glad you could make it. Starting off as you can see my name is <b>Antonio Almaguer</b> and before I start off there is a few things I wish to say first. Well I'm just so very excited to share this news with you but. . .</p>
      <h1><p><b>I'M HAVING A BABY GIRL!!!</b></p></h1>
      <p>Yes, my first child. This year has been crazy with the whole pandemic going on. I've been working full time still through this pandemic and it's scary knowing what's going on around us.</p>
      <p>My girlfriend and I are both <b>34 weeks pregnant</b> and it's been a long journey. We're almost there and nothing but, worries been on my mind the closer we get to her due date.</p>
      <p>Thank goodness  I live with my girlfriend because with this pandemic still around seeing each other would be difficult.</p>
      <p>So for our daughter name we have decided on <b>Milena Almaguer</b> and we simply <b>LOVE</b> the name but, I'm here to <b>ask you</b> for a favor...I would love a <b>middle name</b> but, sadly I cant think of one. I'm hoping you can help us out, it'll be greatly appreciated!</p>

      <h1><b>Hobbies</b></h1>
      <p>Well not much to say here in my opinion.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Playing soccer</b></li>
        <p>Well I always feel it's important to stay active and to exercising even for a few hours is important. Playing soccer was always a hobby of mines growing up. Only thing is due to the pandemic I haven't been able on doing much.</p>
        <li><b>Video Games</b></li>
        <p>Come on now, who don't play video games?</p>
        <p>I love video games. From mobile games such as <b>Pokemon Go</b> and <b>Among Us</b> being my top favorites. Playing both on my <b>PlayStation</b> when I'm home enjoying my day off with a cup of coffee to playing my <b>Nintendo Switch</b> on the go. Hey maybe after this you and I can sometime game together</p>
        <li><b>ANIME and MANGAS</b></li>
        <p>Of course you know I have to mention <b>anime</b> like how can I not? been watching anime since the day I first watched <b>Yu Yu Hakusho</b>.</p>
        <p>Throughout the years, I've watched more anime. My favorite animes are <b>Naruto</b> and <b>Toradora</b> just to name a few. Ongoing anime I'm watching are quite a few also like <b>Fire Force</b>, I've recently finished watching <b>Rent a Girlfriend</b> but, I couldn't wait for the next season so I've read the manga.</p>
        <p>For <b>Mangas</b> I'm currently reading <b>Rent a Girlfriend</b>, <b>Boruto</b>, <b>Bluelock</b> and <b>Promised Neverland</b>.</p>
        <p>If you have any recommendations or want to share some let me know!</p>
